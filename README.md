Have you ever felt tired of going back and forth between blog posts? I know I have so I developed a solution, one where you would need no coding or very little required to set up on your blog.

### What is Auto Load Next Post?
Auto Load Next Post loads the next post once the bottom of the first post the user visits has been reached. The process is repeated until there are no more posts to load.

It simply reads the post navigation in the theme at the end of each post and collects the post URL for the next post / page. WordPress will then do a partial load and place the content of the next post underneath the parent post / page.

Not only that, it updates your web history by manipulating the web address and page title. This allows you to return to any post you have looked at in your browser history. When you refresh the browser, it will load the post / page the user was viewing last.

### First Time Users
For new first time users I suggest reading [the documentation](https://github.com/seb86/Auto-Load-Next-Post/wiki) to understand how to setup the plugin and see how it works. By default when the plugin is activated, the settings are ready to be used with the latest WordPress core theme, Twenty Fifteen.

### Features
* Use action hooks to load content before and after the next post has loaded.
* Restrict it to load only on specific post types.
* Have the option to hide the comments if you wish.
* Track each post load with Google Analytics. ( Requires Google Analytics to be applied for this to work. )
* Over-writable template file.
