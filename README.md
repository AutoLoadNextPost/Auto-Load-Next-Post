Have you ever felt tired of going back and forth between blog posts? I know I have so I decided to develop a solution. One where you would need to do very little coding and require very little to set up on your blog.

### What is it?
Auto Load Next Post is a lightweight plugin that simply loads the previous post, one after another as you scroll down the page. It simply reads the post navigation in your theme at the end of each post and collects the post URL for the previous post. WordPress will then do a partial load and place the content of the previous post underneath the parent post.

Not only that, it updates your web history by manipulating the web address and page title. This allows you to return to any post you have looked at in your browser history. When you refresh the page, the page will take you to the post you were viewing last.

### Features
* Can use action hooks to load content before and after the next post has loaded. - NEW in v1.4.1
* Can restrict it to load only on specific post types.
* You now have the option to hide the comments if you wish.
* Track each post load with Google Analytics. ( Requires Google Analytics to be applied for this to work. )
