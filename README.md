## üîî What is Auto Load Next Post?
Auto Load Next Post is a WordPress plugin developed to increase your pageviews by engaging the site viewers to keep reading your content rather than increasing your bounce rate.

It simply automatically loads the next post on your blog once the user has reached the bottom of the initial post the viewer is reading and repeats the process as the user reads your content until there are no more posts to load.


## ‚úÖ Features
* Customizable repeater template
* jQuery event triggers plus 3rd-party support
* Reduce page load by hiding the post comments
* Track pageviews with Google Analytics. ***Requires Google Analytics to be applied on your site first for this to work.***
* Developer friendly
* Works even for child-themes
* WordPress Network / Multisite Supported
