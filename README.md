### What is Auto Load Next Post?
Auto Load Next Post is a WordPress plugin developed to increase page views by engaging the site viewers to keep them reading the blogs content as they reach the bottom of an article rather than having to go back and select another post to read.

It simply loads the next post on your blog automatically once the user has reached the bottom of the initial post the viewer is reading and repeats as the user reads the content until there are no more posts to load.
